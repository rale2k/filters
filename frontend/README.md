# Filters

An application which has a button to create new filter and representation of already created filters.

Interview exercise for `${COMPANY}`.

## Comments

The following acceptance criteria seemed conflicting to me (should it be resizable or fixed??):

> - Filter dialog **should have fixed size** and be configurable to operate in modal/non-modal mode
> - Let the user **resize only the height**

I chose to make it fixed, following the point:

> - If there are more rows than dialog can fit, scrolling should appear

The design image also showed a select option, but as this was not mentioned in the requirements so I omitted that also.

## Time spent

```
28.06.2025 - 1.5h - checking out requirements, boilerplate setup
29.06.2025 - 8h - dev, test (still not quite satisfied :/)
```
